# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for the latest release and the `main` branch. Please make sure you
are up to date before reporting an issue.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security problems.**

Report privately through GitHub Security Advisories:

<https://github.com/Asahi-Prv/i-AI-Studio/security/advisories/new>

Please include:

- a description of the vulnerability and its impact,
- steps to reproduce or a proof of concept,
- the affected version or commit,
- your environment (OS, how the app is run, whether it is exposed beyond localhost).

You can expect an initial response within about a week. We will coordinate a fix and a disclosure
date with you, and credit you in the release notes unless you prefer otherwise.

## Scope

Intel AI Studio is a local-first management UI for OpenVINO Model Server. The most valuable
reports are:

- authentication bypass, session fixation, or cookie handling issues,
- path traversal in model/runtime deletion or archive extraction,
- cross-site scripting (XSS) in the UI,
- SSRF or allow-list bypasses in the URL/download/install endpoints,
- leaking secrets (Hugging Face token, OVMS API key, password hashes) to the browser or logs,
- denial of service that can be triggered remotely when the app is exposed.

Out of scope:

- vulnerabilities in OVMS, OpenVINO, Hugging Face, Python packages, or downloaded models —
  please report those to the respective project,
- attacks that require an already-compromised local machine or write access to the data directory,
- behavior that only occurs when the app is intentionally exposed with authentication disabled
  and without a reverse proxy. Hardening suggestions for that setup are still welcome.

## Hardening notes

- The UI binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. If you bind it to `0.0.0.0`, enable the UI login and an
  OVMS API key, and terminate HTTPS with a reverse proxy.
- The Hugging Face token and OVMS API key are stored in plain text in `config.json`; the UI
  password is stored as a PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 hash. Protect the data directory accordingly.
- Runtime downloads are restricted to official GitHub release / OpenVINO storage URLs and verify
  published SHA-256 checksums. Archive extraction rejects path-traversal entries.
